# PokeSearch-App
TAMUHack 2016 Hackathon Project

# Inspiration
When Pokemon Go came out, I wanted to create an app using the public PokeApe to give people more information about pokemon.

# What it does
The app allows you to input the PokeDex ID number of the Pokemon whose information you want. Then, you press a PokeBall button, and the name of the pokemon, it's height, and its weight show up.

# How I built it
I used Swift, Xcode, the PokeApi, CocoaPods, and PokemonKit to build the app.
